# dotfiles
vimrc plus who knows what else

### TL;DR - I watched a **Vimconf** talk by [Jess Archer](https://github.com/jessarcher/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/init.vim) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=434tljD-5C8&t=1273s) and thought: "Huh. Maybe I should make a *nice* `.vimrc`..."

### P.S.
Now I'm checking out [Max Cantor]'s(https://github.com/changemewtf/no_plugins/blob/master/no_plugins.vim) "How to do 90% of what Plugins do (with just Vim)" and trying to learn his tricks too.
